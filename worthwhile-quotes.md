I am not that big on quotes, but occasionally I come across some interesting ones which hold some meaning for me. Here is that list:

| Author | Quote |

| Ralph Waldo Emerson | Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be |
| Steve Prefontaine | To give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift |
