# Overview

I want to talk about garnering a better understanding of your Linux file system for the sole purpose of maintenance.

```
/var
|--/cache/pacman            contains packages downloaded via pacman. Allowed to be tossed.
|--/log                     contains old logs. only delete if you know what you're doing here            
```
