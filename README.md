# Standards & Style



It's probably a good thing to mention while this is a collection of thoughts, things, and linked articles, the content linked or copied from respective sources is not mine. I copied it here in case a link goes dead, the site goes down, whatever the case - to keep that information around. If there is an issue with this, go ahead and shoot me an email!  
  
Thanks in advance!
