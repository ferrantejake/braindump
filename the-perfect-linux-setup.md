# The Perfect Linux Setup

There's really no arguing here, I have the perfect setup. In this article I am going to roll through everything I know about setting up a really great development environment without any real explanation as to why. I am making some architectural decisions which contour to my style. Understandably some individuals may prefer another OS or desktop, this is besides the point. I only mention them because they are what I prefer and they are worthy of mention. Focus on the features not the groundwork. There may be some things missing.. let me know by adding making a note in the comments!
