# The Perfect Linux Setup

There's really no arguing here, I have the perfect setup. In this article I am going to roll through everything I know about setting up a really great development environment without any real explanation as to why. I am making some architectural decisions which contour to my style. Understandably some individuals may prefer another OS or desktop, this is besides the point. I only mention them because they are what I prefer and they are worthy of mention. Focus on the features not the groundwork. There may be some things missing.. let me know by adding making a note in the comments!

# System Configuration Notes

* Operating system on a single SSD

# Operating System

Arch Linux

# Desktop

Gnome

# Gnome Extensions

Adding Gnome extensions is a must. This requires the [desktop application](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShellIntegrationForChrome/Installation), the [chrome gnome extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/#), and finally [the extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org)

## Worthwhile Extensions

* AlternateTab
* User themes
* Status menu buttons
* Dash to dock
* Clipboard indicator
* Removable drive menu
* Shelltile
* Native window placement
* Places status indicator
